Welcome to Nexus AI! This guide will help you navigate the platform to accelerate your development workflow.

## 1. Getting Started
Upon launching the application, you will land on the **Dashboard**. Use the sidebar to navigate between different modules.

## 2. The Process Navigator
This is the heart of the platform, guiding you through the software development lifecycle.

### How to Use:
1.  **Select a Stage:** Click the icons at the top (Analysis, Architecture, etc.) to filter templates.
2.  **Choose a Template:** 
    *   **Official (Blue Badge):** System-verified templates.
    *   **Saved (Amber Badge):** Templates you have bookmarked.
    *   **Community:** Templates shared by other users.
3.  **View Details:** Click a card to see the prompt, input requirements, and expected output.

*   **Delete:** You can delete templates you created by clicking the **Trash Icon** inside the detail modal.

## 3. Prompt Library
A collection of specific, role-based prompts for smaller tasks.

### How to Use:

*   **Feedback:** Open a prompt to read comments.
*   **AI Summary:** If a prompt has many comments, click the **✨ AI Summarize Feedback** button to get a quick overview of what others think.

## 4. Playground
Your coding sandbox.

1.  **Chat:** Type your request (or paste a template) on the left.
2.  **Code:** The AI generates code on the right.
3.  **Run:** Click **Run** to see a live preview of web components.
4.  **Analyze:** Click **Analyze** to get an AI-generated efficiency score for your code.

## 5. Tips & Tricks
*   **Bookmarks sort first:** Save your most-used templates to save scrolling time.

*   **Be specific:** When creating your own templates, clearly define the "Input Format" so others know how to use it.
